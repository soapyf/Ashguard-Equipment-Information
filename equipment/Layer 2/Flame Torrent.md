### Damage Falloff
Damage scales linearly from full to zero between the full damage range and max range.
- **Pass 1 – Avatars:** 20m range, 45° cone. Targets must **both** pass a line-of-sight raycast **and** fall within 1.5m of the camera's aim line. The avatar directly under the crosshair (center raycast hit) always receives damage regardless of angle.
- **Pass 2 – LBA Objects:** Same range and cone. Targets scripted objects with a description beginning with `LBA.v.`. Uses the same aim validation as Pass 1.

| Distance  | Avatar Damage | LBA Damage |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| 0 – 5m    | 100           | 10         |
| 7.5m      | 100           | 10         |
| 12.5m     | 50            | ~5         |
| 20m       | 0             | 0          |

> Avatar damage falls off from **5m → 20m**. LBA damage falls off from **7.5m → 20m**.
